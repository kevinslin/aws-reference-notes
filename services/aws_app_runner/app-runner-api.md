## Using AWS CloudShell

- **Note**  
Your IAM identity also requires a policy that grants permission to make calls to App Runner\. For more information, see [How App Runner works with IAM](security_iam_service-with-iam.md)\.
- **Note**  
When using AWS CLI in AWS CloudShell, you don't need to download or install any additional resources\. Moreover, because you're already authenticated within the shell, you don't need to configure credentials before making calls\.
