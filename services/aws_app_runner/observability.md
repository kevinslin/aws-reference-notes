## Metrics (CloudWatch)

- **Note**  
At this time, the console displays only service metrics\. To view instance metrics, use the CloudWatch console\.


## Event handling (EventBridge)

- **Note**  
Some services support *pre\-defined patterns* in EventBridge\. This simplifies how an event pattern is created\. You select field values on a form, and EventBridge generates the pattern for you\. At this time, App Runner doesn't support pre\-defined patterns\. You have to enter the pattern as a JSON object\. You can use the examples in this topic as a starting point\.


## API actions (CloudTrail)

- **Note**  
For security reasons, some property values are redacted in the logs and replaced with the text `HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS`\. This prevents unintended exposure of secret information\. However, you can still see that these properties were passed in the request or returned in the response\.
