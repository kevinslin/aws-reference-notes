## Logging and Monitoring

- **Note**  
CloudTrail does not monitor calls to [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeEndpoint.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeEndpoint.html)\.


## Compliance Validation

- **Note**  
If your use of Amazon SageMaker Studio in AWS East/West regions is subject to FedRAMP Moderate, use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) to configure authentication for Studio\. AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) is currently not in scope for FedRAMP Moderate \(East/West\)\.
