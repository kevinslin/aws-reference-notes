## Onboard to Domain

- **Note**  
If you onboard using IAM authentication and want to switch to authentication using IAM Identity Center later, you must delete the Domain that you created\. Then, you need to manually re\-import all notebooks and other user data that you created\. For more information, see [Delete an Amazon SageMaker Domain](gs-studio-delete-domain.md)\.
- **Note**  
The AWS Organizations account must be in the same AWS Region as Studio and RStudio\.
