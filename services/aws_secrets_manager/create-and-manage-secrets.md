## Create a database secret

- **Tip**  
For some [Secrets managed by other services](service-linked-secrets.md), you use *managed rotation*\. To use [Managed rotation](rotate-secrets_managed.md), you first create the secret through the managing service\.


## Modify a secret

- **Note** that you can't change the name or ARN of a secret\.
