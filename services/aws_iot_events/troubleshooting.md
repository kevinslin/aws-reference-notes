## Common AWS IoT Events issues and solutions

- **Note**  
For the `convert(type, expression)` function, if you use a reference for the *type* value, the evaluated result of your reference must be `String`, `Decimal`, or `Boolean`\.


## Troubleshooting a detector model

- **Note**  
You must fix all errors before you can publish your detector model\.
We recommend that you review warnings and take necessary actions before you use your detector model in production environments\. Otherwise, the detector model might not work as expected\.
You can have up to 10 analyses in the `RUNNING` status at the same time\.
