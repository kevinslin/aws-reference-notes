## Making HTTP Requests

- **Note**  
JSON values in the request body are strings\.
- **Note**  
JSON values in the response are strings\.


## Handling Errors

- **Note**  
If you're polling to determine the status of a request, and if Elastic Transcoder is returning HTTP status code 429 with an error code of `Provisioned Throughput Exceeded Exception` or `Throttling Exception`, consider using notifications instead of polling to determine status\. For more information, see [Notifications of Job Status](notifications.md)\.
