## Creating a Preset

- **Note**  
You cannot update an existing preset\. If you need to change settings in a preset, create a new preset based on the preset that you want to change, update the applicable values, and save the new preset\.


## Deleting a Preset

- **Note**  
You can't delete the system presets that are included with Elastic Transcoder\.
