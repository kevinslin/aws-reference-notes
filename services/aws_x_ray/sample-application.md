## Scorekeep tutorial

- **Note**  
If you created and attached custom policies using the prior section of this tutorial, you must remove the policy from the `scorekeepRole` before deleting the CloudFormation stack\.


## SQL clients

- **Note**  
See [Configuring Databases with Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.db.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* for details on how to add a PostgreSQL database to the application environment\.


## AWS Lambda functions

- **Note**  
Running the `random-name` Lambda function requires the creation of additional resources outside of the Elastic Beanstalk environment\. See the readme for more information and instructions: [AWS Lambda Integration](https://github.com/awslabs/eb-java-scorekeep/tree/xray/README.md#aws-lambda-integration)\.
