## Supported Apache Kafka versions

- **Note**  
Amazon MSK clusters running version 2\.4\.1\.1 are compatible with any Apache Kafka client that is compatible with Apache Kafka version 2\.4\.1\.
- **Note**  
You can no longer create an MSK cluster with Apache Kafka version 2\.4\.1\. Instead, you can use [Amazon MSK bug\-fix version 2\.4\.1\.1](#2.4.1.1) with clients compatible with Apache Kafka version 2\.4\.1\. And if you already have an MSK cluster with Apache Kafka version 2\.4\.1, we recommend you update it to use Apache Kafka version 2\.4\.1\.1 instead\.


## Updating the Apache Kafka version

- **Important**  
You can't update the Apache Kafka version for an MSK cluster that exceeds the limits described in [ Right\-size your cluster: Number of partitions per broker](bestpractices.md#partitions-per-broker)\.
