## AWS security audit guidelines

- **Tip**  
You can monitor your usage of IAM as it relates to security best practices by using [AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html)\. Security Hub uses security controls to evaluate resource configurations and security standards to help you comply with various compliance frameworks\. For more information about using Security Hub to evaluate IAM resources, see [AWS Identity and Access Management controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/iam-controls.html) in the AWS Security Hub User Guide\.
- **Note**  
We recommend that you use [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) to manage user identity in your app\. This service lets you authenticate users using Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect \(OIDC\)â€“compatible identity provider\. For more information, see [Amazon Cognito identity pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*\.
