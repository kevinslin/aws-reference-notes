## Permissions required

- **Note**  
Throughout the AWS documentation, when we refer to an IAM policy without mentioning any of the specific categories, we mean an identity\-based, customer managed policy\. For details about policy categories, see [Policies and permissions in IAM](access_policies.md)\.
- **Note**  
Some services support resource\-based policies as described in [Identity\-based policies and resource\-based policies](access_policies_identity-vs-resource.md) \(such as Amazon S3, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS\)\. For those services, an alternative to using roles is to attach a policy to the resource \(bucket, topic, or queue\) that you want to share\. The resource\-based policy can specify the AWS account that has permissions to access the resource\.
