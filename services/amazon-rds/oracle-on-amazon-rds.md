## Importing data into Oracle

- **Important**  
Before you use the preceding migration techniques, we recommend that you back up your database\. After you import the data, you can back up your RDS for Oracle DB instances by creating snapshots\. Later, you can restore the snapshots\. For more information, see [Backing up and restoring](CHAP_CommonTasks.BackupRestore.md)\.


## Upgrading the Oracle DB engine

- **Important**  
RDS for Oracle Database 11g is desupported\. If you maintain Oracle Database 11g snapshots, you can upgrade them to a later release\. For more information, see [Upgrading an Oracle DB snapshot](USER_UpgradeDBSnapshot.Oracle.md)\.
