## Viewing instance status and recommendations

- **Note**  
Amazon RDS also uses another status called *maintenance status*, which is shown in the **Maintenance** column of the Amazon RDS console\. This value indicates the status of any maintenance patches that need to be applied to a DB instance\. Maintenance status is independent of DB instance status\. For more information about maintenance status, see [Applying updates for a DB instance](USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.OSUpgrades)\.


## Analyzing performance with DevOpsÂ Guru for RDS

- **Important**  
We recommend that you test any changes on a test instance before modifying a production instance\. In this way, you understand the impact of the change\.
