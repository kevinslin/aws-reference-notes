## Data protection

- **Note**  
Amazon Cognito encrypts customer content internally and doesn't support customer provided keys\.


## AWS managed policies

- **Note**  
Because creating a new identity pool also requires creating IAM roles, any user you want to be able to create new identity pools with must have the admin policy applied as well\.
