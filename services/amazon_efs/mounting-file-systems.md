## Mounting with EFS mount helper

- **Note**  
Amazon EFS does not support mounting from Amazon EC2 Windows instances\.
- **Note**  
The watchdog process ensures that each mount's stunnel process is running, and stops the stunnel when the Amazon EFS file system is unmounted\. If for some reason a stunnel process is terminated unexpectedly, the watchdog process restarts it\.
- **Important**  
You can enable logging for the stunnel process logs\. However, enabling the stunnel logs can use up a nontrivial amount of space on your file system\.
- **Note**  
Amazon EFS file systems do not support automatic mounting on Amazon EC2 Mac instances running macOS Big Sur\.
- **Note**  
Amazon EFS file systems do not support mounting on Amazon EC2 Mac instances running macOS Big Sur at instance launch\.
- **Note**  
You can't use Amazon EFS with Microsoft Windowsâ€“based Amazon EC2 instances\.
- **Note**  
Amazon EFS file systems do not support automatic mounting using `/etc/fstab` on Amazon EC2 Mac instances running macOS Big Sur\.
- **Note**  
Before you can update the `/etc/fstab` file of your EC2 instance, make sure that you already created your Amazon EFS file system\. For more information, see [Step 1: Create your Amazon EFS file system](gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.md)\.
- **Note**  
In some cases, your Amazon EC2 instance might need to start regardless of the status of your mounted Amazon EFS file system\. In such cases, add the `nofail` option to your file system's entry in your `/etc/fstab` file\.


## Additional mounting considerations

- **Note**  
If your EC2 instance needs to start regardless of the status of your mounted EFS file system, add the `nofail` option to your file system's entry in your `/etc/fstab` file\.


## Troubleshooting AMI and kernel versions

- **Note**  
Amazon EFS does not support mounting from Amazon EC2 Windows instances\.
