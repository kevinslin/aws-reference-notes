## Dedicated connections

- **Note**  
You cannot use the AWS Direct Connect console to request a hosted connection\. Instead, contact an AWS Direct Connect Partner, who can create a hosted connection for you, which you then accept\. Skip the following procedure and go to [ Accept your hosted connection](getting_started.md#get-started-accept-hosted-connection)\.
- **Note**  
For more information about pricing, see [AWS Direct Connect Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/)\. If you no longer want the connection after you have reissued the LOA\-CFA, you must delete the connection yourself\. For more information, see [Delete connections](deleteconnection.md)\.
