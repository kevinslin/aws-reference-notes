## Classic

- **Note**  
You cannot use the AWS Direct Connect console to request a hosted connection\. Instead, contact an AWS Direct Connect Partner, who can create a hosted connection for you, which you then accept\. Skip the following procedure and go to [ Accept your hosted connection](#get-started-accept-hosted-connection)\.
- **Important**  
A campus is treated as a single AWS Direct Connect location\. To achieve high availability, configure connections to different AWS Direct Connect locations\.
