## Prerequisites

- **Note**  
The Discovery Agent has a 32\-bit agent executable, which works on 32\-bit and 64\-bit operating systems\. The number of installation packages needed for deployment is reduced by having a single executable\. This executable agent works for Linux and for Windows OS\. It is addressed in their respective installation sections that follow\.


## Install on Linux

- **Note**  
If you are using a non\-current Linux version, see [Requirements on older Linux platforms](#old_linux)\.<a name="linux_steps"></a>


## Install on Windows

- **Note**  
The hotfixes for SHA256 support for Windows 2003 are no longer publicly available from Microsoft\. If these fixes are not already installed in your Windows 2003 host, manual upgrades are necessary\.
- **Note**  
If you choose to reinstall the agent after uninstalling it, run the following command with the `/repair` and `/norestart` options\.
