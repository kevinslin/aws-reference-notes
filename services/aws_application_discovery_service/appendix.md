## Appendix: Discovery Connector

- **Important**  
We recommended that all customers currently using Discovery Connector transition to the new Agentless Collector\. Customer's currently using Discovery Connector can continue to do so until Aug 31, 2023\. After this date, data sent to AWS Application Discovery Service by Discovery Connector will not be processed\. Going forward, Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector is the supported discovery tool for agentless data collection by AWS Application Discovery Service\. For more information, see [Appendix: Transition from Discovery Connector to Agentless Collector](discovery-collector-transition.md)\.
