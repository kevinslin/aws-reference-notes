## Using the AWS Copilot CLI

- **Note**  
The source code for the AWS Copilot CLI is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli)\. The latest CLI documentation is available on the AWS Copilot [website](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/)\. We recommend that you submit issues and pull requests for changes that you would like to have included\. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of AWS Copilot code\. Report issues with AWS Copilot by connecting with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/aws/copilot-cli) or [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli) where you can open issues, provide feedback, and report bugs\.
- **Important**  
The warning in the output is expected and is not problematic\. It occurs because there is not a chain of trust between your personal PGP key \(if you have one\) and the Amazon ECS PGP key\. For more information, see [Web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust)\.
