## Using AWS IoT Core with VPC endpoints

- **Note**  
The VPC feature for automatically creating a DNS record is disabled\. To connect to these endpoints, you must manually create a Private DNS record\. For more information about Private VPC DNS records, see [Private DNS for interface endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-interface.html#vpce-private-dns)\. For more information about AWS IoT Core VPC limitations, see [Limitations of VPC endpoints](#VPC-limitations)\.
- **Note**  
AWS IoT Core does not support [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.html#vpc-endpoint-policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.html#vpc-endpoint-policies)VPC endpoint policies at this time\.
