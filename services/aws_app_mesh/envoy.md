## Envoy configuration variables

- **Note**  
App Mesh Envoy 1\.17 doesn't supports Envoyâ€™s **v2 xDS** API\. If you're using [Envoy configuration variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy-config.html) that accept Envoy config files, they must be updated to the latest** v3 xDS** API\.


## Envoy defaults set by App Mesh

- **Note**  
No matter if your Envoys have the Envoy or App Mesh default circuit breaker values, you cannot modify the values\.
