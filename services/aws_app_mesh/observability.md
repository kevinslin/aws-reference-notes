## Logging

- **Important**  
Make sure to check that your input pattern is valid for Envoy, or Envoy will reject the update and store the latest changes in the `error state`\.


## Tracing

- **Important**  
To fully implement tracing, you'll need to update your application\.  
To see all the available data from your chosen service, you'll have to instrument your application using the applicable libraries\.
