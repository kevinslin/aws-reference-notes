## Install/Update

- **Important**  
AWS CLI versions 1 and 2 use the same `aws` command name\. If you previously installed AWS CLI version 1, see [Migrating from AWS CLI version 1 to version 2](cliv2-migration.md)\.
- **Important**  
The warning in the output is expected and doesn't indicate a problem\. It occurs because there isn't a chain of trust between your personal PGP key \(if you have one\) and the AWS CLI PGP key\. For more information, see [Web of trust](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust)\.
- **Note**  
When updating from a previous version, the `unzip` command prompts to overwrite existing files\. To skip these prompts, such as with script automation, use the `-u` update flag for `unzip`\. This flag automatically updates existing files and creates new ones as needed\.
- **Note**  
To update your current installation of the AWS CLI, add your existing symlink and installer information to construct the `install` command with the `--update` parameter\.
- **Note**  
You can view debug logs for the installation by pressing **Cmd\+L** anywhere in the installer\. This opens a log pane that enables you to filter and save the log\. The log file is also automatically saved to `/var/log/install.log`\.


## Past releases

- **Note**  
To update your current installation of the AWS CLI version 2 to a newer version, add your existing symlink and installer information to construct the `install` command with the `--update` parameter\.
