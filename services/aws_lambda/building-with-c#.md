## Handler

- **Important**  
If the method specified in your handler string is overloaded, you must provide the exact signature of the method that Lambda should invoke\. If the resolution would require selecting among multiple \(overloaded\) signatures, Lambda will reject an otherwise valid signature\.


## Tracing

- **Note**  
You cannot configure the X\-Ray sampling rate for your functions\.
