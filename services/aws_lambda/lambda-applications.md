- **Note**  
On Windows, some Bash CLI commands that you commonly use with Lambda \(such as `zip`\) are not supported by the operating system's built\-in terminals\. To get a Windows\-integrated version of Ubuntu and Bash, [install the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)\.
