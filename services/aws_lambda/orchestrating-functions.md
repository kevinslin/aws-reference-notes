## Manage state machines

- **Note**  
When a Lambda function is [dynamically referenced with JsonPath](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-paths.html) in the state machine definition, the function details cannot be shown in the Lambda console\. Instead, the function name is listed as a **Dynamic reference**, and the corresponding steps in the graph are grayed out\.
