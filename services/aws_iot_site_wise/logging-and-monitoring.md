## Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch metrics

- **Tip**  
AWS IoT SiteWise publishes metrics on a one minute interval\. When you view these metrics in graphs in the CloudWatch console, we recommend that you choose a **Period** of **1 minute**\. This lets you see the highest available resolution of your metric data\.
- **Important**  
To receive gateway metrics, you must use at least version 6 of the AWS IoT SiteWise connector on your gateway\. For more information, see [AWS IoT SiteWise connector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/iot-sitewise-connector.html) in the *AWS IoT Greengrass Version 1 Developer Guide*\.
