## Setting up AWS IoT SiteWise gateways (Greengrass V1)

- **Note**  
Gateways running on AWS IoT Greengrass V1 are available only if you started using this feature before July 29, 2021\. Otherwise, you [set up gateways running on AWS IoT Greengrass V2](configure-gateway-ggv2.md)\.


## Managing gateways

- **Important**  
Your gateway device and the AWS OpsHub application must be connected to the same network\.
- **Important**  
To access your gateway with Linux credentials, you must enable the data processing pack for your gateway\.
