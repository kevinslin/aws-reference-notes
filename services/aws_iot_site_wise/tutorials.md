## Visualizing and sharing wind farm data in SiteWise Monitor

- **Note**  
When you use SiteWise Monitor, you're charged per user that signs in to a portal \(per month\)\. In this tutorial, you create three users, but you only need to sign in with one user\. After you complete this tutorial, you incur charges for one user\. For more information, see [AWS IoT SiteWise Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/pricing/)\.
