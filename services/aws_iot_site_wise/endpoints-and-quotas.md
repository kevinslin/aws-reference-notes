## Endpoints

- **Note**  
By default, AWS IoT SiteWise uses the consolidated endpoint when you make calls to the supported control plane API operations\.
We recommend that you use the consolidated endpoint for the supported control plane API operations\.
You can't use the consolidated endpoint to access the SiteWise Monitor API operations\.
