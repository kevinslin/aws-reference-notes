## Using the quick start demo

- **Important**  
You will be charged for the resources that this demo creates and consumes\.
- **Note**  
The demo creates Lambda functions, one CloudWatch Events rule, and the IAM roles required for the demo\. You might see these resources in your AWS account\. We recommend that you keep these resources until you're done with the demo\. If you delete the resources, the demo might stop working correctly\.
