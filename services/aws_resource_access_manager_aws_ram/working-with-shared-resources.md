## Regional and global resources

- **Important**  
Currently, you can create resource shares with global resources **only in the designated home Region **US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region, `us-east-1`\. Although you can create the resource share only in that single home Region, any shared global resource appears as a standard global resource when viewed in that service's console or CLI and SDK operations\. The restriction to the home Region applies only to the resource share, not the resources it contains\.
- **Considerations**
