## Create code reviews

- **Note**  
We recommend that you use both CodeGuru Reviewer and traditional peer review processes during the code review stage\. Using a combination of code review processes helps to identify more issues before they reach production\.


## View all code reviews

- **Note**  
After 90 days have passed since a code review was done, you can't view that code review in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer console\. But you might be able to view the recommendations from incremental code reviews in the repository source provider\.
