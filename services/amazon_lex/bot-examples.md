## Schedule Appointment

- **Note**  
In this example, we show how to use response cards\. The Lambda function constructs and returns a response card to Amazon Lex\. The response card lists available days and times as buttons to choose from\. When testing the bot using the client provided by the Amazon Lex console, you cannot see the response card\. To see it, you must integrate the bot with a messaging platform, such as Facebook Messenger\. For instructions, see [Integrating an Amazon Lex Bot with Facebook Messenger](fb-bot-association.md)\. For more information about response cards, see [Managing Messages ](howitworks-manage-prompts.md)\.


## Updating Utterances

- **Note**  
Utterance statistics are generated once a day\. You can see the utterance that was not recognized, how many times it was heard, and the last date and time that the utterance was heard\. It can take up to 24 hours for missed utterances to appear in the console\.
