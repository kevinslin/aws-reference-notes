## Automatic Scaling

- **Note**  
If your domain has scaled up to accommodate your index size and you delete a large number of documents, the domain scales down the next time the full index is rebuilt\. Although the index is automatically rebuilt periodically, to scale down as quickly as possible you can explicitly [run indexing](indexing.md) when you are done deleting documents\.
