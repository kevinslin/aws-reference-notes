## Setting up

- **Important**  
The provisioning certificate that you generate in this procedure is only valid for 5 minutes\. If you do not complete the registration process within this time frame, you must start over\.
- **Important**  
Before you continue, remove the USB drive from the appliance and format it to delete its contents\. The configuration archive contains sensitive data and is not deleted automatically\.


## Supported models and cameras

- **Note**  
For a list of pre\-built models that have been tested with AWS Panorama, see [Model compatibility](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-panorama-developer-guide/blob/main/resources/model-compatibility.md)\.
