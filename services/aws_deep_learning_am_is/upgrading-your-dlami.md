## DLAMI Upgrade

- **Note**  
When attaching and moving Amazon EBS volumes between DLAMIs, you must have both the DLAMIs and the new volume in the same Availability Zone\.


## Software Updates

- **Note**  
We cannot guarantee that a package update will be successful\. Attempting to update a package in an environment with incompatible dependencies can result in a failure\. In such a case, you should contact the library maintainer to see if it is possible to update the package dependencies\. Alternatively, you can attempt to modify the environment in such a way that allows the update\. However, this modification will likely mean removing or updating existing packages, which means that we can no longer guarantee stability of this environment\.
