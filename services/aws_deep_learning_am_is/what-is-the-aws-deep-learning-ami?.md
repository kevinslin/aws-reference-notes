# What Is the AWS Deep Learning AMI?

{% hint style="info" %}
This page was generated from content adapted from the [AWS Developer Guide](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-deep-learning-amis.git)
{% endhint %}

## Example Uses

- **Note**  
While your initial choice might be to upgrade your instance type up to a larger instance with more GPUs \(up to 8\), you can also scale horizontally by creating a cluster of DLAMI instances\. To quickly set up a cluster, you can use the predefined AWS CloudFormation template\. Check out [Related Information](resources.md) for more information on cluster builds\.


## Features

- **Note**  
We no longer include the CNTK, Caffe, Caffe2, Theano, Chainer, or Keras Conda environments in the AWS Deep Learning AMI starting with the v28 release\. Previous releases of the AWS Deep Learning AMI that contain these environments will continue to be available\. However, we will only provide updates to these environments if there are security fixes published by the open source community for these frameworks\.
