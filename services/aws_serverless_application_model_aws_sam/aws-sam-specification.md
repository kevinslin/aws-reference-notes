## Generated resources

- **Note**  
The `LogicalIds` of some generated resources include a unique hash value to avoid namespace clashes\. The `LogicalIds` of these resources are derived when the stack is created\. You can retrieve them only after the stack has been created using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or one of the AWS SDKs\. We don't recommend referencing these resources by `LogicalId` because the hash values might change\.
- **Note**  
Not all generated AWS CloudFormation resources have referenceable properties\. For those resources, you must use the `LogicalId`\.
