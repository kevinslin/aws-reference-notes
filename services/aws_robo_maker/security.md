## Authentication and access control

- **Important**  
To get started quickly, review the introductory information on this page and then see [Getting Started with IAM](auth_access_getting-started.md)\. You can optionally learn more about authentication and access control by viewing [What is Authentication?](auth_access_what-is-authentication.md), [What is Access Control?](auth_access_what-is-access-control.md), and [What are Policies?](auth_access_what-are-policies.md)\.
- **Important**  
All resources in an account are owned by the account, regardless of who created those resources\. You must be granted access to create a resource\. However, just because you created a resource does not mean that you automatically have full access to that resource\. An administrator must explicitly grant permissions for each action that you want to perform\. That administrator can also revoke your permissions at any time\.
