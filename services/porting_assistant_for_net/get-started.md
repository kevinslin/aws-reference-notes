## Prerequisites

- **Note**  
These requirements are provided as estimates\. Individual solutions can vary for memory usage\.


## Port solution

- **Important**  
When you port a solution, your project files and code are modified\. Your project file is modified to include compatible packages you selected and other packages detected by the assessment\. In addition, Porting Assistant adds or backs up code files based on the type of projects detected\. Some code files are changed to make them more compatible with \.NET Core\. The result is not a completely ported project\. The project may not build, and additional source code changes may be required\. Any added or modified code must be verified and tested before it can be considered production ready\.
