## Monitor memory and disk metrics

- **Important**  
The CloudWatch monitoring scripts are deprecated\. We strongly recommend that you use the CloudWatch agent to collect metrics and logs\. For more information, see [ Collect Metrics from Amazon EC2 Instances and On\-Premises Servers with the CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.  
If you are still migrating from the deprecated monitoring scripts to the agent, and require information about the monitoring scripts, see [Deprecated: Collect metrics using the CloudWatch monitoring scripts](monitoring-scripts-intro.md)\.
