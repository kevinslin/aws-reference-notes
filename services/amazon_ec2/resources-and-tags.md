## Recycle Bin

- **Note**  
Some resources might still appear in the Recycle Bin console or in the AWS CLI and API output for a short period after their retention periods have expired and they have been permanently deleted\. You are not billed for these resources\. Billing stops as soon as the retention period expires\.


## List and filter your resources

- **Important**  
You cannot use a private window in Firefox to access Amazon EC2 Global View\.


## Tag your resources

- **Note**  
After you delete a resource, its tags might remain visible in the console, API, and CLI output for a short period\. These tags will be gradually disassociated from the resource and be permanently deleted\.
- **Note**  
If you've just enabled reporting, data for the current month is available for viewing after 24 hours\.
- **Note**  
Elastic IP addresses that are tagged do not appear on your cost allocation report\.
- **Note**  
The way you enter JSON\-formatted parameters on the command line differs depending on your operating system\.  
Linux, macOS, or Unix and Windows PowerShell – Use single quotes \('\) to enclose the JSON data structure\.
Windows – Omit the single quotes when using the commands with the Windows command line\.
