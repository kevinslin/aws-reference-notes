## Step 1: Set Up a User

- **Note**  
An IAM user with administrator permissions has unrestricted access to the AWS services in your account\.  The code examples in this guide assume that you have a user with the `AmazonTextractFullAccess` permissions\. `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` is required for examples that access documents that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket\. Depending on your security requirements, you might want to use an IAM group that's limited to these permissions\. For more information, see [Creating IAM Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_create.html)\.
