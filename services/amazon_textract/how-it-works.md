## Detecting Text

- **Note**  
The Amazon Rekognition API operation `DetectText` is different from `DetectDocumentText`\. You use `DetectText` to detect text in live scenes, such as posters or road signs\.


## Analyzing Identity Documents

- **Note**  
 Some identity documents, such as driver's licenses, have two sides\. You can pass the front and back images of driver licenses as separate images within the same Analyze ID API request\.
