## What is cryptography?

- **Note**  
Cryptography relies extensively on mathematics\. This includes basic function theory, permutations, probability, information theory, complexity theory, number theory, and more\. The math underlying cryptography is beyond the scope of this documentation, but printed and online sources are readily available\.
