## Post-deployment steps

- **Note**  
The root certificate will be stored as `c:\servername.cer` on each RD gateway when deploying servers using the CloudFormation templates\.


## Troubleshoot

- **Note**  
When you enable **Deactivate rollback on failed deployment**, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack\. Ensure that you delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting\.
