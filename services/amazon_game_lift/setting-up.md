## Set up an account

- **Important**  
We strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks\. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform\. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html) in the *AWS Account Management Reference Guide*\.
- **Note**  
For your convenience, the AWS sign\-in page uses a browser cookie to remember your IAM user name and account information\. If you previously signed in as a different user, choose the sign\-in link beneath the button to return to the main sign\-in page\. From there, you can enter your AWS account ID or account alias to be redirected to the IAM user sign\-in page for your account\.


## Amazon GameLift hosting locations

- **Important**  
To use Regions that aren't enabled by default, enable them in your AWS account\.  
Fleets with Regions that aren't enabled that you created before February 28, 2022 are unaffected\.
To create new multi\-location fleets or to update existing multi\-location fleets, first enable any Regions that you choose to use\.
