## VPC peering

- **Note**  
VPC peering is an advanced feature\. To learn about preferred options for enabling your game servers to communicate directly and privately with your other AWS resources, see [Communicate with other AWS resources from your fleets](gamelift-sdk-server-resources.md)\.
- **Note**  
The new VPC peering connection is not completed until the fleet is ready to become active\. This means that the connection is not available and can't be used during the game server build installation process\.
