## Device Differences

- **Note**  
When this guide refers to *Snowball Edge devices*, it's referring to all optional variants of the device\. Whenever specific information applies only to one or more optional configurations \(such as how the Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU option has an on\-board GPU peripheral\), it is mentioned explicitly\.
- **Note**  
Workloads that need GPU support require the Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU option\.
