## Managing fleet indexing

- **Important**  
July 20th, 2022 is the General Availability release of AWS IoT Device Management fleet indexing's integration with AWS IoT Core named shadows and AWS IoT Device Defender detect violations\. With this GA release, you can index specific named shadows by specifying shadow names\. If you added your named shadows for indexing during this feature's public preview period from November 30, 2021 to July 19, 2022, we encourage you to reconfigure your fleet indexing settings and choose specific shadow names to reduce indexing cost and optimize performance\.


## Querying for aggregate data

- **Note**  
 For issues with missing or unexpected values for the aggregation APIs, read [Fleet indexing troubleshooting guide](fleet-indexing-troubleshooting.md)\.
