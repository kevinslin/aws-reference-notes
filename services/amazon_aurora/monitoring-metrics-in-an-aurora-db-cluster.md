## Viewing cluster status and recommendations

- **Note**  
Aurora also uses another status called *maintenance status*, which is shown in the **Maintenance** column of the Amazon RDS console\. This value indicates the status of any maintenance patches that need to be applied to a DB cluster\. Maintenance status is independent of DB cluster status\. For more information about maintenance status, see [Applying updates for a DB cluster](USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.OSUpgrades)\.
