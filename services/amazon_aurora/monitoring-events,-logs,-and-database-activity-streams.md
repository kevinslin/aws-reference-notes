## Monitoring Aurora logs

- **Note**  
In some cases, logs contain hidden data\. Therefore, the AWS Management Console might show content in a log file, but the log file might be empty when you download it\.


## Monitoring Aurora API calls in CloudTrail

- **Note**  
If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in **Event history**\.
