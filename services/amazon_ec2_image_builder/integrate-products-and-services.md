## AWS Marketplace

- **Note**  
Data product providers must meet the AWS Data Exchange eligibility requirements\. For more information, see [Providing Data Products on AWS Data Exchange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/providing-data-sets.html) in the *AWS Data Exchange User Guide*\.
- **Note**  
If you're looking for a product that you just subscribed to, and you don't see it in the list, use the refresh button at the top of the tab to refresh your results\. It might take a few minutes for a new subscription to appear in the list\.
- **Note**  
If your image product subscription includes an AWSTOE build component, you can select it from the **Build components** list\. Select `Third party managed` from the component owner type list to see it\. If your product subscription includes an AWSTOE test component, follow the same procedure for the **Test components** list\.


## Amazon Simple Notification Service

- **Note**  
If your SNS topic is encrypted, the key that encrypts this topic must reside in the account where the Image Builder service runs\. Image Builder can't send notifications to SNS topics that are encrypted with keys from other accounts\.
