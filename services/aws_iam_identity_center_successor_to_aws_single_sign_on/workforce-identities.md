## Manage your identity source

- **Note**  
IAM Identity Center does not support SAMBA4\-based Simple AD as an identity source\.


## Multi-factor authentication

- **Important**  
As a security best practice, we strongly recommend that you enable multi\-factor authentication\. MFA provides a simple and secure way to add an extra layer of protection on top of the default authentication mechanism of user name and password\.
