## Migrate from Version 1

- **Note**  
AWS IoT Greengrass Version 1 no longer receives feature updates, and will receive only security patches and bug fixes until June 30, 2023\. For more information, see the [AWS IoT Greengrass V1 maintenance policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v1/developerguide/maintenance-policy.html)\. If you use AWS IoT Greengrass V1, we strongly recommend that you migrate to AWS IoT Greengrass V2\.
- **Note**  
The AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript V2 doesn't currently support AWS IoT Greengrass V2\. If your V1 applications use either of these features and the AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK for Node\.js, you can't run them on V2 yet\.
