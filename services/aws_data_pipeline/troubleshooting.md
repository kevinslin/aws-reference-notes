## Locating Error Logs

- **Note**  
Task Runner stores its logs in a different location by default, which may be unavailable when the pipeline finishes and the instance that runs Task Runner terminates\. For more information, see [Verifying Task Runner Logging](dp-how-task-runner-user-managed.md#dp-verify-task-runner)\.


## Resolving Common Problems

- **Note**  
If you provide a runsOn value and workerGroup exists, workerGroup is ignored\.
- **Note**  
In this error message, PollForTask may be replaced with names of other AWS Data Pipeline permissions\.
