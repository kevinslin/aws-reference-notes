## Getting started with an IAM Identity Center identity source (console)

- **Note**  
If using Active Directory or an external identity provider as your identity source, you must map the email addresses of your users to IAM Identity Center user names when you specify the System for Cross\-domain Identity Management \(SCIM\) protocol\. For more information, see the [IAM Identity Center guide on SCIM for enabling IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/scim-profile-saml.html)\.
