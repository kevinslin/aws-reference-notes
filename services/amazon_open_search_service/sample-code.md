## Signing HTTP requests

- **Important**  
The latest versions of the Elasticsearch clients might include license or version checks that artificially break compatibility\. For the correct client version to use, see [Elasticsearch client compatibility](samplecode.md#client-compatibility)\.
- **Tip**  
This sample uses the default credential chain\. Run `aws configure` using the AWS CLI to set your credentials\.


## Using the AWS SDKs

- **Important**  
For examples of how to interact with the OpenSearch APIs, such as `_index`, `_bulk`, `_search`, and `_snapshot`, see [Signing HTTP requests to Amazon OpenSearch Service](request-signing.md)\.
