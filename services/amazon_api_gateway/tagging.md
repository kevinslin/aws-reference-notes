## API Gateway resources that can be tagged

- **Note**  
Tag inheritance applies only to [attribute\-based access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html)\. For example, you can't use inherited tags to monitor costs in AWS Cost Explorer\. API Gateway doesn't return inherited tags when you call [GetTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-tags.html) for a resource\.
