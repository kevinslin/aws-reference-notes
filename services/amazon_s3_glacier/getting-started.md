## Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault

- **Important**  
Any archive operation, such as upload, download, or deletion, requires you to use the AWS Command Line Interface \(CLI\) or write code\. There is no console support for archive operations\. For example, to upload data, such as photos, videos, and other documents, you must either use the AWS CLI or write code to make requests, by using either the REST API directly or by using the AWS SDKs\.   
To install the AWS CLI, see [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\.
