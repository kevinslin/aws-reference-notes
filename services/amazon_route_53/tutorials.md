## Transitioning to latency-based routing in Amazon Route 53

- **Note**  
Data about the latency between users and your resources is based entirely on traffic between users and AWS data centers\. If you aren't using resources in an AWS Region, the actual latency between your users and your resources can vary significantly from AWS latency data\. This is true even if your resources are located in the same city as an AWS Region\.


## Weighting fault-tolerant multi-record answers in Amazon Route 53

- **Note**  
Records that use the multivalue answer routing policy behave in much the same way as the configuration that is documented in this tutorial\. The main difference is that the tutorial configuration lets you specify weights, which can be useful when your endpoints have different capacities\. For more information, see [Multivalue answer routing](routing-policy-multivalue.md)\.
