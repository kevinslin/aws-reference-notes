## Working with records

- **Note**  
To create records for complex routing configurations, you can also use the traffic flow visual editor and save the configuration as a traffic policy\. You can then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names \(such as example\.com\) or subdomain names \(such as www\.example\.com\), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones\. In addition, you can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as you expected it to\. For more information, see [Using traffic flow to route DNS traffic](traffic-flow.md)\.
