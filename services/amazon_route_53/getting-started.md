## Use your domain for a static website

- **Note**  
You can also transfer an existing domain to Route 53, but the process is more complex and time\-consuming than registering a new domain\. For more information, see [Transferring registration for a domain to Amazon Route 53](domain-transfer-to-route-53.md)\.
- **Note**  
Amazon S3 does not support HTTPS access to the website\. If you want to use HTTPS, you can use Amazon CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3\.   
For more information, see [Requiring HTTPS for Communication Between Viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html)\.
