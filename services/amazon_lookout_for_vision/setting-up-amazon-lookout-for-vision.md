## Step 2: Set up permissions

- **Note**  
If you only use AWS SDK operations, you can use policies that are scoped to AWS SDK operations\. For more information, see [Set up SDK permissions](su-sdk-permissions.md)\.


## Step 3: Create the console bucket

- **Note**  
If you only use the AWS SDK and not the Lookout for Vision console, you don't need to create the console bucket\. You can use a different S3 bucket with a name of your choosing\.
