## Example datasets

- **Note**  
Later, when you create a dataset with the console, Amazon Lookout for Vision can use the folder names \(`normal` and `anomaly`\) to label the images automatically\. For more information, see [Creating a dataset using images stored in an Amazon S3 bucket](create-dataset-s3.md)\.
