## Making API requests

- **Note**  
You can also use the AWS SDKs when developing applications with Transfer Family;\. The AWS SDKs for Java, \.NET, and PHP wrap the underlying Transfer Family API, simplifying your programming tasks\. For information about downloading the SDK libraries, see [Sample Code Libraries](http://aws.amazon.com/code)\.
