# What Is AWS Control Tower?

## How It Works

- **Note**  
It is not recommended to run any type of production workloads from an AWS Control Tower management account\. Create a separate AWS Control Tower account to run your workloads\.
- **Note**  
The AWS CloudFormation StackSet `BP_BASELINE_CLOUDTRAIL` is not deployed in landing zone versions 3\.0 or later\. However, it continues to exist in earlier versions of the landing zone, until you update your landing zone\.
