## Deleting Resources

- **Note**  
Deleting a resource tree deletes only Amazon Forecast resources\. It doesn't delete datasets or exported files stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)\.


## Receiving Notifications

- **Note**  
We recommend using Amazon EventBridge to manage events\. CloudWatch Events and EventBridge use the same API and provide the same functionality, but EventBridge provides more features\. Changes that you make in either CloudWatch or EventBridge will appear in each console\. For more information, see [Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/index.html)\.
