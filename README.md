Used to have a running joke with colleagues that any part of aws documentation that started with a **Note** was simply footgun waiting to blow up. 

These footguns came in the form of technical considerations, exceptions, and caveats that would take anywhere between an hour or a month to work around. 


- when provisioning anything via cloudformation/cdk/terraform, reverse engineering what IAM permissions, security groups, versions, and other settings needed to be in place to have a successful deployment
- service limits 
- cross account restrictions
- 


This is a compilation of all **Note-able** areas of the AWS Docs, extracted from the AWS public documentation.

It is a work in progress.
