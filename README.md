Used to have a running joke with colleagues that any part of aws documentation that started with a **Note** was simply footgun waiting to blow up (aka take anywhere between 1h-1month of engineering time to work around)

This is a compilation of all **Note-able** areas of the AWS Docs, extracted from the AWS public documentation.

It is a work in progress
